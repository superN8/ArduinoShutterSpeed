# ArduinoShutterSpeed
A script for arduino uno using a light sensor to measure shutter speed
Based on code from an article available at:
https://emulsive.org/articles/how-to-build-a-simple-arduino-shutter-speed-tester-by-ethan-moses
The original code could work if the receiver pins for ground and out were switched
But this code offers a fix to keep the pins the same, and changes when the data is recorded
Hopefully this will improve accuracy and efficiency
